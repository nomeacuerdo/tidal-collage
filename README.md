# Tidal collage

This is a test case of an application where you authenticate with Tidal and input a playlist URL.

The application then fetches the tracks of that playlist and renders the cover arts in a neat way.

You can change the dimensions and columns of the canvas to generate an image! :-)

## About

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
This uses the [Tidal API](https://developer.tidal.com/documentation/api-sdk/api-sdk-overview) and the [Tidal Web SDK](https://github.com/tidal-music/tidal-sdk-web)

**Don't forget to create your .env file! There's a sample file**
